# cyclone_intesity_estimationModel
This project aims to provide a powerful and accurate tool for predicting cyclone intensity using  Deep Learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Cyclone intensity estimation is a crucial task for disaster management and preparedness, and our model is designed to enhance the accuracy of these predictions.

steps to test the model 
1 - run the the download.py file this will download the dataset 
2 - run the assemble.py file that will clean the image will generate the numpy arrays for train the model 
3 - you can run the model.py file but you need to download the dependencies or you can copy the code at the google colab and train the model you can try the diffrent architectures .
