# cyclone_intesity_estimationModel
This project aims to provide a powerful and accurate tool for predicting cyclone intensity using  Deep Learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Cyclone intensity estimation is a crucial task for disaster management and preparedness, and our model is designed to enhance the accuracy of these predictions.
